      <h2>Jeff Sydney</h2>
      <small>Head of Innovation</small>

      <p>At Everwill, we believe our attorneys should spend all their time on what matters most: our clients. As Head of Innovation, Jeff Sydney makes their hard work behind the scenes flow smoothly and efficiently</p>
       
      <p>Jeff joined Everwill after 30 years of experience practicing law. With a JD from Stanford Law School and an MBA from the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business, Jeff founded a successful private firm where he led a team of attorneys in delivering top-notch estate plans and nurturing long-lasting client relationships. When he was ready for a new challenge, he funneled his decades of expertise into another passion: business transformation.</p>
       
      <p>As Head of Innovation, Jeff oversees our test kitchen of ideas, designing a cutting-edge platform that includes ongoing education, apps, and other proprietary tools that help our attorneys stay ahead of changes to estate tax law and update plans whenever the need arises. Jeff ensures that our lawyers have at their fingertips everything they need to develop plans customized to your circumstances, no matter what they are.</p>
       
      <div class="once_i">
        <h4>“Today, there is a greater need than ever for tailor-made estate plans that protect your loved ones,” Jeff explains. “Estate planning is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor. It’s easy to draw up a will, but if you’re not working with a skilled attorney you can trust, you’ll lack the confidence that your family will be taken care of when the time comes.”</h4>
      </div>
      
       
      <p>Plenty of people put off planning for the future -- it can be daunting or uncomfortable. Some only seek professional advice when life surprises them with the death of a loved one or an unexpected diagnosis. This hesitation has left a lot of clients unprepared as the largest wealth transfer in history gets underway, with Baby Boomers preparing to pass on more than $59 trillion in the coming decades.</p>
       
      <div class="once_i">
        <h4>“It’s no longer enough to simply protect your assets,” Jeff continues. “You need your attorney to create value for you.”</h4>
      </div>
             
      <p>With the benefit of Jeff’s business acumen, our attorneys can construct robust estate plans that safeguard your family, and you can walk away not only with your future planned, but with a burden lifted.</p>

      <h2>Peng Li</h2>
      <small>Founder & Head of Attorney Development</small>

      <div class="once_i">
        <h4>“I want to help lawyers fall in love with their profession again,” says Peng, explaining her desire to help found Everwill. </h4>
      </div>
      
      <p>Peng didn’t always love her own job. After nine years as a patent attorney at a number of BigLaw firms, where the race to rack up billable hours and make partner overshadowed more satisfying accomplishments, Peng struck out on a year-long journey. At its end, she hoped to find a new career, or a fresh way to make her commitment to the law feel inspiring.</p>

      <p>Peng indulged her passion for travel first, spending time in South America, India, and Southeast Asia. She hiked the Inca Trail in Peru, toured the Jain temples of Jaisalmer, India’s “Golden City,” and spent a week in silence on a Balinese island.</p>

      <p>Home again, she self-published her first novel in Chinese, and relaxed with friends and family. Most of them pleaded with her to return to the law, but Peng refused to go back until she could do so in a way that felt authentic.</p>

      <p>She had witnessed firsthand how so many lawyers, drawn to the profession out of a desire to make a difference in their communities, ended up slogging through jobs they hated. Even those who ventured into establishing their own practice struggled, unable to drum up enough clients or keep up with the marketing, accounting, and administrative needs of the business. She knew there had to be another way.</p>

      <div class="once_i">
        <h4>“What if I could build a workplace where the lawyers were all driven by the same mission, and we collaborated with each other instead of competing against one another?” she asked herself.</h4>
      </div>

      <p>Peng helped found Everwill to create exactly that: a community of supportive, law-loving entrepreneurs. We offer our team of attorneys the tools they need to thrive. As a result, we can put our clients first, and gauge our success based not on how many hours we bill, but on how many clients we help.</p>

      <h2>Janice Shen</h2>
      <small>Head Attorney</small>

      <p>Every family has their own story to tell. The trick is listening for it, and that’s Janice’s specialty.</p>
       
      <div class="once_i">
        <h4>“Once I understand what is most important to my clients and what keeps them up at night, I can create the best plan for their family,” Janice explains.</h4>
      </div>
       
      <p>Estate planning is a relationship, not a transaction, and that’s what Janice values most about her work: the human connections she forges with her clients. She’ll guide you through the decision-making process with compassion and expertise, and tailor a plan to suit your wishes. She’s available whenever you have a question or need to update your plans, and she’ll gently steer your family through the necessary steps when the time comes to implement the plan you’ve created. </p>

      <p>Families face unique challenges when planning for the future, and Janice’s clients appreciate her ability to simplify complex legal matters and provide a clear understanding of what will happen to their estate after death. Blended families, extended families, children and adults with special needs, pets, parents, siblings, and families built out of shared lives rather than blood all have different concerns. </p>

      <p>Janice ensures our community of attorneys communicate and collaborate as a team so we can harness our collective experience for all of our clients whenever there’s a particularly delicate issue.</p>

      <p>It can bring comfort to know that the lawyer who helps you draw up your estate plans will work with your spouse or children later on to fulfill your wishes. Janice is conscientious about following through with what the trust makers want and to treat their loved ones with kindness.</p>
       
      <p>As mother to a young son herself, Janice understands firsthand how critical it is to plan for your death – and how emotional it can be. Like all of us, she’s uneasy about dying, but she finds purpose in delivering peace of mind to her clients, who can rest easier knowing they’ve taken care of their loved ones.</p>
